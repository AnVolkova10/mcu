                        engine</strong> designed by <strong class="secundary">Dr. Wendy Lawson</strong>, whom Vers

                    Rambeau and her daughter <strong class="monica-rambeau">Monica</strong> reveal that Vers is Carol
                    Danvers, who was once like family to them. Talos, arriving unarmed, explains that the Skrulls are
                    refugees searching for a new home and that Lawson was Mar-Vell, a renegade Kree scientist helping
                    them. Talos plays a recovered recording from Lawson's jet, prompting Danvers to remember the crash:
                    Yon-Rogg killed Lawson to prevent her from stro before the Kree could recover it. <strong>Destroying

                    Danvers, Talos, Fury, and Rambeau locate Lawson's cloaked laboratory orbiting Earth, where Lawson
                    hid several Skrulls,

                        source of
                        Lawson's engine</strong>. There, Danvers is captured by Starforce and interfaces with the
                    Supreme Intelligence. Danvers removes the <strong>Kree implant</strong> that suppressed her powers
                    during their conversation, allowing her to reach her <strong>full potential</strong>. In the
                    subsequent battle, Fury retrieves Goose, who is revealed to be an <strong class="goose">alien

                    destroys a Kree bomber, forcing Kree officer <strong class="enemy">Ronan the Accuser</strong> and
                    his squadron to retreat before overpowering Yon-Rogg on Earth and sending him back to Hala with a
                    warning to the Supreme Intelligence. Danvers departs to help the Skrulls find a new homeworld,

                    <strong class="iron-man">Tony Stark</strong>, who has inherited the defense contractor <em>Stark
                        Industries</em> from his father Howard Stark, is in war-torn Afghanistan with his friend and
                    military liaison, Lieutenant Colonel <strong class="war-machine">James Rhodes</strong>, to
                    demonstrate the new "Jericho" missile. After the demonstration, the convoy is ambushed and Stark is
                    critically wounded by a missile used by the attackers: one of his company's own. He is captured by a
                    terrorist group called the <em>Ten Rings</em>. <strong class="secundary">Yinsen</strong>, a fellow
                    captive doctor, implants an <strong>electromagnet</strong> into Stark's chest to keep the shrapnel
                    shards that wounded him from reaching his heart and killing him. Stark and Yinsen secretly build a
                    small, powerful electric generator called an <strong>arc reactor</strong> to power Stark's
                    electromagnet and a <strong>prototype suit of powered armor</strong> to aid in their escape. <strong

                    and his father's legacy. In his home workshop, Stark builds in secret a <strong>sleeker, more
                        powerful version of his improvised armor suit</strong> as well as a <strong>more powerful arc
                        reactor</strong>. Personal assistant <strong class="pepper">Pepper Potts</strong> places the

                    and

                    Blonsky's team. Blonsky agrees to be <strong>injected</strong> with a small amount of a similar
                    serum of Banner, which gives him <strong>enhanced speed, strength, agility, and healing</strong>
                    and
                    begins to <strong>deform his skeleton and impairs his judgment</strong>.

                    attacked a
                    second time by Ross and Blonsky's forces. Banner contacts Mr. Blue, who urges them to meet him in
                    New
                    York City. He is a cellular biologist named <strong class="enemy">Dr. Samuel Sterns</strong>, who
                    tells Banner he has developed a possible antidote.. After a <strong>successful test</strong>, he
                    warns
                    Banner that the antidote may only reverse each transformation. Sterns reveals he has
                    <strong>synthesized Banner's blood samples</strong>, into a large supply, to apply its
                    <strong>"limitless potential"</strong>. Banner wishes to destroy the blood supply. A recovered
                    Blonsky joins Ross' forces for a third attempt to take Banner into custody. They succeed, and
                    Banner and Betty are taken away in a helicopter. Blonsky stays behind and orders <strong

                    <strong class="maria-hill">Agent Maria Hill</strong> arrive at a remote research facility during an

                    In Stuttgart, Barton steals <strong>iridium needed to stabilize the Tesseract's power</strong> while
                    Loki causes a distraction, leading to a brief confrontation with Rogers, Stark, and Romanoff that
                    ends with <strong>Loki's surrender</strong>. While Loki gets escorted to S.H.I.E.L.D., <strong

                    Upon arrival, Loki gets imprisoned while Banner and Stark attempt to locate the Tesseract. The

                </p>
                <p>
                    Loki uses the <strong lass="mcu">Tesseract, and a wormhole generator</strong> Selvig built, to open
                    a wormhole above Stark Tower to the <strong>Chitauri fleet</strong> in space, launching his

                    Rogers, Stark, Romanoff, Barton, and Thor rally in defense of New York City. Banner arrives and
                    transforms into the Hulk, and together the Avengers battle the Chitauri while evacuating civilians.
                    The Hulk <strong>beats Loki into submission</strong>. Romanoff makes her way to the generator, where
                    <strong class="secundary">Selvig</strong>, freed from Loki's mind control, reveals that Loki's
                    scepter can shut down the generator. Meanwhile, Fury's superiors from the <em>World Security
                        Council</em> attempt to end the invasion by <strong>launching a nuclear missile.</strong> Stark
                    <strong>intercepts the missile and takes it through the wormhole</strong> toward the Chitauri fleet.
                    The <strong>missile detonates, destroying the Chitauri mothership and disabling their forces
                    </strong> on Earth. Stark's suit loses power, and he falls back through the wormhole just as

                    veterans, reveals he is the real Mandarin. After capturing Stark, Killian reveals he has subjected
                    Potts to Extremis in the hope Stark will help fix Extremis's flaws while trying to save her. When

                    Extremis to cure his young daughter's disability. On the platform, Stark works to save Potts, as
                    Rhodes goes after the President. Stark <strong>summons his remaining Iron Man suits</strong>,
                    controlled remotely by J.A.R.V.I.S., to provide air support. <strong

                    and kills Killian to save Stark. As a sign of his devotion to Potts, Stark orders J.A.R.V.I.S. to

                    <strong>the Convergence</strong>, a rare alignment of the Nine Realms, is imminent; as the event
                    approaches, portals linking the worlds appear at random.

                    <strong class="heimdall">Heimdall</strong> alerts Thor that Foster has moved beyond his near
                    all-seeing vision, leading Thor to find Foster, she inadvertently releases an <strong>unearthly

                    recognizing the Aether, warns that the Aether will not only kill Foster but that its return heralds
                    a catastrophic prophecy.
                    <strong class="enemy">Malekith</strong>, awakened by the Aether's release, turns <strong

                    to Svartalfheim, where they will use Foster to lure and confront Malekith.
                    Loki tricks Malekith into drawing the Aether out of Foster, but Thor's attempt to destroy the
                    exposed substance fails. Malekith merges with the Aether and leaves in his ship as <strong

                    to the mental trauma he suffered during Loki's attack on Earth. Malekith plans to restore the Dark
                    Elves to dominance by unleashing the Aether at the center of the Convergence in Greenwich. Thor
                    battles <strong class="dead enemy">Malekith</strong> and wins.

                    Thor returns to Asgard, where he declines <strong class="presumably-dead odin">Odin</strong>'s offer
                    to take the throne and tells Odin of Loki's sacrifice. As he leaves, Odin's form transforms into

                    with the objective of making humanity surrender its freedom in exchange for security. The pair

                <p>
                    On the abandoned planet Morag, <strong class="star-lord">Peter Quill</strong> steals a <strong
                        class="mcu">mysterious orb</strong>, but is attacked by <strong class="enemy">Korath</strong>,
                    of the fanatical Kree renegade, <strong class="enemy">Ronan the Accuser</strong>. Although Quill
                    escapes with the orb, <strong class="enemy">Yondu</strong> (his boss) discovers his theft and issues
                    a bounty for his capture, while Ronan sends the assassin <strong class="gamora">Gamora</strong>
                    after the orb.
                </p>
                <p>When Quill attempts to sell the orb on Xandar, capital of the Nova Empire, Gamora ambushes him and
                    steals it. A fight ensues, drawing in a pair of bounty hunters: the genetically and cybernetically
                    modified raccoon <strong class="rocket">Rocket</strong>, and the tree-like humanoid <strong
                        class="groot">Groot</strong>. Nova Corps officers capture the four, detaining them in the Kyln
                    prison. An inmate there, <strong class="drax">Drax the Destroyer</strong>, attempts to kill Gamora
                    due to her association with the powerful intergalactic warlord, <strong
                        class="boss">Thanos</strong>, and Ronan, who killed his family. Quill convinces Drax that Gamora
                    can bring Ronan to him, though Gamora reveals that she has betrayed Ronan, unwilling to let him use
                    the orb's power. Learning that Gamora intends to sell the orb to <strong class="secundary">the
                        Collector Taneleer Tivan</strong>, Quill, Rocket, Groot, and Drax work with her to escape the
                    Kyln in Quill's ship, <strong>the Milano.</strong></p>
                <p>
                    Tivan opens the orb, revealing <strong class="power-stone">the Power Stone</strong>, an item of
                    <strong>immeasurable power that destroys all but the most powerful beings who wield it. </strong>
                    Tivan's slave Carina grabs the Stone, triggering an explosion that engulfs Tivan's archive. Ronan
                    arrives and easily defeats Drax, while the others flee by ship, pursued by Ronan's followers and
                    Gamora's adoptive sister <strong class="enemy">Nebula</strong>. Nebula destroys Gamora's ship,
                    leaving her floating in space, and Ronan's fighters capture the orb.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Yondu arrives and retrieves the pair. Quill negotiates a truce, promising the orb to Yondu. On
                    Ronan's flagship, the Dark Aster, Ronan <strong class="mcu">embeds the Stone in his warhammer,
                        taking its power for himself.</strong> He contacts Thanos, threatening to kill him after first
                    destroying Xandar; hateful of her adoptive father, Nebula allies with Ronan. The Ravagers and
                    Quill's group join with the Nova Corps to confront the Dark Aster at Xandar, with Quill's group
                    breaching the Dark Aster with the Milano. Ronan uses his empowered warhammer to destroy the Nova
                    Corps fleet. Drax kills <strong class="secundary dead">Korath</strong> and Gamora defeats Nebula,
                    who escapes, Rocket crashes a Ravager ship through the Dark Aster. Damaged, crash-lands on Xandar,
                    with <strong class="groot presumably">Groot</strong> sacrificing himself to shield the group. Ronan
                    emerges from the wreck and Drax and Rocket to destroy <strong class="mcu dead">Ronan's
                        warhammer</strong>. Quill grabs the freed <strong class="power-stone">Power Stone</strong>, and
                    with Gamora, Drax, and Rocket sharing its burden, uses it to vaporize <strong

                </p>
                <p>
                    In the aftermath, Quill tricks Yondu and gives the real <strong class="power-stone">Stone</strong>
                    to the <em>Nova Corps</em>. As the Ravagers leave Xandar, Yondu remarks that it turned out well that
                    <strong class="mcu">they did not deliver Quill to his father per their contract</strong>. Quill's
                    group, now known as <strong>the Guardians of the Galaxy</strong>, has their criminal records
                    expunged, and Quill learns that <strong class="mcu">he is only half-human</strong>, his father being
                    part of an ancient, unknown species. Quill finally opens the last present he received from his
                    mother, a cassette tape filled with her favorite songs. <strong class="groot">Groot</strong> grows
                    into a baby version of him.

                    attacks the Guardians' ship with a
                    fleet of drones. A <strong>mysterious figure destroys the drones</strong>, whom reveals to be
                    Quill's father, <strong class="enemy">Ego</strong>, and invites them to his home planet. Rocket and
                    Groot remain behind to repair the ship and guard
                    Nebula.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ayesha hires <strong class="enemy">Yondu Udonta</strong>, who have been exiled from
                    <em>the Ravager</em> community for child trafficking, to recapture the Guardians.
                    They capture Rocket, but when Yondu hesitates to turn over Quill, whom he raised,
                    his assistant <strong class="secundary">Kraglin Obfonteri</strong> questions his objectivity,
                    and his lieutenant <strong class="enemy">Taserface</strong> leads a mutiny with help from Nebula.
                    Nebula leaves to find and kill Gamora, whom she blames for the torture inflicted on her
                    by their father, Thanos. While imprisoned, Rocket and <strong class="secundary">Yondu</strong>
                    bond. Groot and Kraglin, free Rocket and Yondu, and they destroy the ship and its crew
                    as they escape, but <strong class="enemy dead">Taserface</strong> warns the Sovereign before dying.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ego, a <strong>god-like Celestial that manipulated the matter around</strong> its
                    consciousness to form this "home" planet, explains that he projected a humanoid guise to travel
                    the universe and discover a purpose. Ego hired Yondu to collect the young Quill after
                    <strong class="secundary">Meredith's</strong> death, but the boy was never delivered,
                    and Ego has been searching for him ever since. He teaches Quill <strong>to manipulate the
                        Celestial power.</strong> Nebula arrives at Ego's planet and tries to kill Gamora,
                    but the pair reach an uneasy alliance when they discover a <strong>cavern filled with
                        skeletal remains.</strong> Ego reveals to Quill that in his travels, he planted seedlings
                    on thousands of worlds that can terraform into new extensions of himself,
                    but only the power of two Celestials can activate them.
                    To that end, he impregnated countless women and hired Yondu to collect the children,
                    but killed them all when they failed to access the Celestial power.
                    Under Ego's influence, Quill helps him activate the seedlings, which <strong>begin to consume
                        every world</strong>, but Quill fights back when Ego reveals that <strong>he gave Meredith the
                        tumor that killed her</strong>. <strong class="mantis">Mantis</strong>, Ego's naïve empath
                    servant,
                    grows close to Drax and warns him of Ego's plan. The reunited Guardians find Ego's brain at the
                    planet's core as they come under attack from the Sovereign's drones. Rocket makes a bomb using
                    the stolen batteries, which Groot plants on the brain. Quill fights Ego with his newfound Celestial
                    powers to distract him. <strong>The bomb explodes</strong>, killing <strong class="enemy dead">
                        Ego</strong> and disintegrating the planet. Quill <strong>loses his Celestial powers</strong>
                    soon after Ego's death. <strong class="secundary dead">Yondu</strong> sacrifices himself to
                    save Quill and dies in the vacuum of space.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Quill then realizes that Yondu kept him to spare him from the fate of Ego's other progeny. Having
                    reconciled with Gamora, <strong class="nebula">Nebula</strong> still chooses to leave and resume
                    her quest to kill Thanos by
                    herself. The Guardians hold a funeral for Yondu, which Kraglin and dozens of Ravager ships attend,
                    acknowledging Yondu's sacrifice and accepting him as a Ravager again. During the funeral, Gamora
                    admits that she feels things for Peter too.

                    death. Even well into his adult years, his father’s dark lessons in cruelty, power, respect, and
                    control helped mold him into the man he is today, <strong class="enemy">the Kingpin</strong>.</p>

                    Crime is in an all-time high due to the rise of a crime syndicate: utilizing drugs, weapons, and

                    Their very first client, <strong class="secundary">Karen Page</strong>, grateful for the duo’s save,
                    decides to work with them. Murdock continued his vigilantism and Wilson Fisk, falls in love to art

                    secretly working

                    Fisk for criminal activity and was arrested. Finally donning the Daredevil costume, Murdock

                    In the Eastern European country of Sokovia, the Avengers: <strong class="iron-man">Tony

                    —raid a <em>Hydra facility</em> commanded by <strong class="enemy">Baron Wolfgang von
                        Strucker</strong>, who has experimented on humans using the scepter previously wielded by Loki.
                    They meet two of Strucker's test subjects—twins <strong class="pietro">Pietro</strong> (who has
                    superhuman speed) and <strong class="scarlet-witch">Wanda Maximoff</strong> (who has telepathic and
                    telekinetic abilities)—and apprehend Strucker, while Stark retrieves <strong class="mcu">Loki's
                        scepter</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Stark and Banner discover an <strong>artificial intelligence within the scepter's gem</strong>, and
                    secretly decide to use it to complete Stark's <strong>"Ultron" global defense program</strong>. The
                    unexpectedly sentient <strong class="enemy">Ultron</strong>, believing he must <strong>eradicate
                        humanity to save Earth</strong>, eliminates Stark's A.I. <strong
                        class="jarvis presumably-dead">J.A.R.V.I.S.</strong> and attacks the Avengers at their
                    headquarters. Escaping with the scepter, Ultron uses the resources in Strucker's Sokovia base to
                    upgrade his rudimentary body and build an army of robot drones. Having killed <strong
                        class="enemy dead">Strucker</strong>, he recruits the Maximoffs, who hold Stark responsible for
                    their parents' deaths by his company's weapons, and goes to get <strong>vibranium</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A worldwide backlash over the resulting destruction, and the fears <strong>Wanda's hallucinations
                        incited</strong>, send the team into hiding at Barton's farmhouse. Thor departs to consult with
                    <strong class="secundary">Dr. Erik Selvig</strong> on the apocalyptic future he saw in his
                    hallucination, while <strong class="fury">Nick Fury</strong> arrives and encourages the team to form
                    a plan to stop Ultron. Ultron uses Loki's scepter to enslave the team's friend <strong
                        class="secundary">Helen Cho</strong>. They use her <strong>synthetic-tissue technology,
                        vibranium, and the scepter's gem to craft a new body</strong>. As Ultron uploads himself into
                    the body, Wanda is able to read his mind; discovering his plan for human extinction, <strong>the
                        Maximoffs turn against Ultron</strong>. Rogers, Romanoff, and Barton fight Ultron and retrieve
                    the synthetic body, but Ultron captures Romanoff.
                </p>

                    Stark and Banner secretly upload <strong class="jarvis">J.A.R.V.I.S.</strong> —who is still working
                    after hiding from Ultron inside the Internet—into the synthetic body. Thor returns to help activate
                    the body, based on <strong class="mcu">his vision</strong> that the gem on its brow is the <strong
                        class="mind-stone">Mind Stone</strong>, one of <strong class="mcu">the six Infinity
                        Stones</strong>, <strong>the most powerful objects in existence</strong>. This "<strong

                        hammer, Mjölnir</strong>. The <strong class="mind-stone">Mind Stone</strong> is in Vision's
                    head.
                    Him and the Maximoffs go with the Avengers to Sokovia, where Ultron
                    has used the remaining vibranium to build a machine to lift a large part of the capital city
                    skyward, intending to crash it into the ground to cause global extinction. Banner rescues Romanoff,
                    who awakens the Hulk for the battle. The Avengers fight Ultron's army while Fury arrives in a
                    Helicarrier with <strong class="maria-hill">Maria Hill</strong>, <strong class="war-machine">James
                        Rhodes</strong>, and <em>S.H.I.E.L.D.</em> agents to evacuate civilians. <strong

                    Wanda abandons her post to destroy <strong class=" enemy pressumably dead">Ultron</strong>'s primary
                    body, which allows one of his drones to activate the machine. The city plummets, but Stark and Thor
                    overload the machine and shatter the landmass. In the aftermath, the Hulk, unwilling to endanger
                    Romanoff by being with her, departs in a Quinjet, while Vision confronts and seemingly destroys
                    <strong class="enemy dead">Ultron</strong>'s last remaining body.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thor returns to Asgard to learn more about the forces he suspects have manipulated major events. As
                    Stark leaves and Barton retires, Rogers and Romanoff prepare to <strong>train new Avengers:</strong>

                    Rogers stops Barnes and sneaks him away. When Barnes regains his senses, he explains that Zemo is
                    the real Vienna bomber and wanted the location of the Siberian Hydra base, where other brainwashed
                    "Winter Soldiers" are kept in cryogenic stasis. Rogers and Wilson go rogue, and recruit Maximoff,
                    <strong class="hawkeye">Clint Barton</strong>, and <strong class="ant-man">Scott Lang</strong> to
                    their cause. With Ross's permission, Stark assembles a team composed of Romanoff, T'Challa, Rhodes,
                    <strong class="vision">Vision</strong>, and <strong class="spider-man">Peter Parker</strong> to
                    capture the renegades. Stark's team intercepts Rogers' group at Leipzig/Halle Airport, where they
                    fight until Romanoff allows Rogers and Barnes to escape. As Rogers and Barnes are escaping, Rhodes
                    is inadvertently shot down by Vision (who was ~falling in love~ with Wanda), and becomes partially
                    paralyzed. The rest of Rogers' team is captured and detained at the Raft prison, and Romanoff goes
                    into exile.

                    Stark discovers evidence that Barnes was framed by Zemo and convinces Wilson to give him Rogers'
                    destination. Without informing Ross and <strong class="secundary">Everett K. Ross</strong>,
                    Stark goes to the Siberian Hydra facility and strikes a truce
                    with Rogers and Barnes, unaware that they were secretly followed by T'Challa. They find that the
                    other super-soldiers have been killed by Zemo, who then shows them footage that reveals that the
                    automobile Barnes had intercepted in 1991 contained Stark's parents, whom Barnes subsequently
                    killed. Enraged that Rogers kept this from him, Stark turns on them both, leading to an intense
                    fight, in which Stark destroys Barnes' robotic arm, and Rogers disables Stark's armor. Rogers
                    departs with Barnes, <strong>leaving his shield behind</strong>. Satisfied that he has avenged his
                    family's deaths in Sokovia from the Avengers' actions by successfully fracturing them, Zemo attempts
                    suicide, but he is stopped by T'Challa and taken to the authorities.

                    In the aftermath, Stark provides Rhodes with exoskeletal leg braces that allow him to walk again,
                    while Rogers breaks his allies out of the Raft. Barnes, granted asylum in
                    Wakanda, <strong>chooses to return to cryogenic sleep until a cure for his brainwashing is
                        found.</strong> Parker explores the features of the web shooters built for him by Stark.

                <p>
                    <strong class="black-widow">Natasha Romanoff</strong> is a fugitive from the government for
                    violating the Sokovia Accords. Elsewhere, <strong class="yelena">Yelena</strong> is still working
                    for <em>the Red Room</em>, where she kills a former Black Widow, only to come in contact with a
                    substance called Red Dust that removes the Red Room's control of her. She sends the antidote to
                    Romanoff's safehouse in the hopes that she will return to help her. As Romanoff unknowingly drives
                    off with the antidote, she is attacked by <strong class="enemy">Taskmaster</strong>, who is after
                    the Red Dust. Romanoff manages to evade Taskmaster and learns that the Dust came from Belova. The
                    two reunite in Budapest, but are then attacked by Black Widows. While escaping, Romanoff learns the
                    Red Room is still active and that its leader, <strong class="enemy">Dreykov</strong>, is still
                    alive. She defected SHIELD for the killing of Dreykov. After detonating a building with him and his
                    young daughter Antonia in it (an act that has haunted her), both were presumed dead.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Natasha and Yelena break <strong class="secundary">Alexei</strong> out of prison to learn where
                    Dreykov is and he tells them that they need to speak with <strong class="secundary">Melina</strong>
                    who has been living on a farm in Russia using mind control on pigs. Belova reveals that while they
                    were not a real family, she still wanted to believe that they were so, while Shostakov and Vostokoff
                    admit that they too wished they were a real family. Vostokoff gives away their location to Dreykov
                    whose agents arrive and take them away to the Red Room, which is located on an aerial base.
                </p>

                    Romanoff learns that <strong class="secundary">Taskmaster</strong> is Antonia, who had suffered
                    damage so severe that Dreykov was forced to put a chip in her head to help her, turning her into the
                    perfect soldier. Romanoff also discovers that she cannot harm Dreykov due to a pheromone lock in
                    him. After goading Dreykov into punching her in the face, Romanoff intentionally severs a nerve in
                    her nasal passage to negate the pheromone and allow herself to attack Dreykov. Belova creates a Red
                    Dust bomb that releases the Widows from mind control. Romanoff gets into the control desk and copies
                    the locations of the other Widows worldwide to a portable drive just as the ship begins to explode
                    and fall. Before leaving the control room, she picks up two vials of Red Dust that survived Belova's
                    bomb. Vostokoff and Shostakov are forced to escape the ship via aircraft just as Belova takes out
                    <strong class="enemy dead">Dreykov</strong>'s escape ship, killing him.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Romanoff gives Belova a parachute as she and Antonia have one final battle through the sky before
                    safely landing on the ground. Romanoff uses one vial of Red Dust on Antonia, freeing her from
                    servitude. The rest of the Widows arrive as Belova, Vostokoff, and Shostakov say goodbye to
                    Romanoff, with Belova giving her her vest to remember her by and Romanoff giving Belova the last Red
                    Dust vial and the portable drive, telling her to find and free the other Widows. As they leave along
                    with a recovering Antonia, Romanoff awaits the arrival of <strong class="enemy">Ross</strong> and

                    is a front for a technologically advanced civilization. Erik attacks and extracts Klaue as Ross is
                    gravely injured protecting Nakia. Rather than pursue Klaue, T'Challa takes Ross to Wakanda, where

                    While Shuri heals Ross, T'Challa confronts Zuri about N'Jobu. Zuri explains that N'Jobu planned to
                    share Wakanda's technology with people of African descent around the world to help them conquer
                    their oppressors. The boy they left grew up to be Stevens, a black ops U.S. Navy SEAL who adopted
                    the name "Killmonger". Meanwhile, Killmonger kills <strong class="enemy dead">Klaue</strong> and
                    takes his body to Wakanda. He is brought before the tribal elders, revealing his identity to be

                    similar to T'Challa's. W'Kabi and his army fight Shuri, Nakia, and the Dora Milaje, while Ross

                    The Hand includes Alexandra (who has gone by many names through the centuries), <strong

                    defeated all that oppose them, except for Stick and the Iron Fist. Stick decapitates <strong

                    wants the Iron Fist as a key to unlock something, the group decides to hide Rand away. Natchios
                    begins to regain memories of her previous life. Murdock and Jones learn that there is something
                    beneath Midland Circle, <strong>a hole</strong> which Murdock had come across previously. <strong

                    tricks Rand into opening the door, causing a blast that knocks out power throughout the city. Rand
                    awakens beneath <strong>the skeleton of a dragon.</strong> Gao explains to Rand <strong>that the
                        substance that the Hand uses for resurrection comes from the bones of dragons</strong>, just as
                    his Iron Fist abilities came from a dragon. Wing decapitates <strong

                    The timer for the explosives sets off accidentaly. Jones, Murdock, and Cage arrive in the cavern to
                    help Rand, and they fight the members of the Hand together. When Murdock realizes that the
                    explosives are about to go off, he gets the others to leave immediately. He remains to plead with
                    <strong class="elektra dead">Elektra</strong>, and the two are together—along with
                    <strong class="enemy presumably-dead">Gao and Murakami</strong> —as the building implodes around
                    them. These events are all covered up by authorities. Rand, Jones, and Cage look to move on and

                    leaves the Runaways utterly shocked.

                    Another newcomer arrives as well: <strong class="secundary">Xavin</strong>, an extraterrestrial who
                    claims to be Karolina's betrothed. This puzzles the Runaways, who then meet with new PRIDE member
                    Chase, who tells them about PRIDE's weapons and attempts to convince them to follow his path.
                    However, they all refuse, starting an intense confrontation in which both PRIDE and the Runaways are
                    seriously affected. Dale, whose wife is possessed by the Magistrate's Wife, decides to take both
                    Gert and Old Lace away. Geoffrey and Catherine are arrested by the LAPD thanks to Alex's effort to
                    frame them for a crime, while Robert is heavily wounded in a fight against Nico. The Gibborim also
                    reunite and manage to capture Janet, Chase and Karolina, threatening to sacrifice them to restore
                    their bodies. This only leaves Alex, Nico and Molly as the free Runaways, a pregnant -with a
                    gibborin child- Leslie and Xavin.

                    <strong class="iron-fist">Danny Rand</strong> moves in with his girlfriend <strong
                        class="colleen-wing">Colleen Wing</strong>, living in her Chinatown, New York City dojo. He sees
                    an increase in crime between <em>Triad gangs</em> following the destruction of the Hand. Colleen
                    finds a box bearing the kamon of her family. <strong class="secundary">Joy</strong> asks for Danny
                    and <strong class="secundary">Ward</strong> to buy her out of the company; Danny agrees. Joy is
                    working with <strong class="enemy">Davos</strong> who reveals to Danny that he has discovered a way
                    to take the Iron Fist from Danny.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Danny meets a strange newcomer to the city, <strong class="secundary">Mary</strong>, and helps her
                    by giving her directions. Learning of Joy and Davos's partnership, Ward asks Danny to invite the
                    pair over for dinner so they can all discuss their differences. Joy learns that her PI, <strong
                        class="secundary">Walker</strong> has dissociative identity disorder, with Mary being an
                    alternate personality; Walker insists that she can control Mary. Danny attempts to reignite peace
                    talks between the triads. They are met by Detective <strong class="secundary">Misty Knight</strong>.
                    Danny is attacked, drugged, and taken by Walker to the site of a ritual in which the bowl, skin, and
                    Danny's blood are used to <strong>transfer the power of the Iron Fist to Davos.</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Davos looks to become the Iron Fist that Danny never was, starting with ending the triad war
                    himself. Joy confirms that she knew what Davos planned all along and had wanted to hurt Danny.
                    Hoping that they can reverse the process, Colleen and Misty go to find them leaving Ward to watch
                    over Danny, Joy, and Walker. Walker watches Mary's message, and is confused when Mary thanks her for
                    breaking them out of a Sokovian prison where they were a prisoner-of-war for years while serving in
                    the military. Walker always believed that it was Mary who broke them out, and her psychiatrist
                    suggests that <strong>they may have another alternate personality.</strong> Danny suggests that
                    Colleen should take the power from Davos. Colleen <strong>agrees to take the Iron Fist</strong>
                    after refusing it a lot of times, but the ritual is interrupted leaving both Davos and Colleen with
                    the power. Misty, Ward, and Walker find Joy, and Ward takes her to safety. Walker then attacks
                    Misty. In pain from the interrupted ceremony, Davos flees back to his hideout and is pursued by
                    Colleen, also in pain, and Danny. Walker waits for Davos to return and attempts to kill him, but
                    Danny warns that killing Davos will kill Colleen as well until the ritual is complete. Misty wakes
                    up, escapes capture, and helps Danny stop Walker by triggering Mary. Colleen fights Davos, and is
                    able to draw the rest of the Iron Fist power out of him.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With Davos arrested, Danny is unsure of his purpose in life. <strong
                        class="colleen-wing iron-fist">Colleen</strong> prepares to protect the streets of Chinatown as
                    the new Iron Fist: <strong>her birthright Danny discovers</strong>, while Joy attempts to return to
                    her normal life. Walker, considering the possibility of having another, more violent identity,
                    decides to stay affiliated with Joy and her influence. Danny decides to leave New York to find
                    <strong class="secundary">Orson Randall</strong>, the man from whom Davos acquired the Iron Fist
                    corpse. Ward travels with him, and months later Danny <strong>has stolen two guns from Randall with
                        which he can form Iron Fists.</strong>

                    After being seriously injured when a building collapses on him, <strong class="daredevil">Matt

                    Orphanage, where Matt was raised. As he slowly recovers, Matt has a crisis of faith and decides that
                    he would rather put his life in danger and continue fighting as Daredevil than return to his
                    civilian life. <strong class="secundary">Karen Page and Foggy Nelson</strong>, start to lose hope
                    that he may still be alive. In prison, criminal <strong class="enemy">Wilson Fisk</strong> decides
                    to make a deal with the <em>FBI</em> to protect his love <strong class="enemy">Vanessa
                        Mariana</strong>. The case is assigned to Agent <strong class="secundary">Ray Nadeem</strong>,
                    who is struggling with being unable to receive a promotion due to financial troubles. Fisk's intel
                    leads to the arrest of the elusive Albanian syndicate's leaders. Nadeem agrees to move Fisk out of
                    prison, but their convoy is attacked by the Albanians. Fisk is saved by Agent <strong
                        class="enemy">"Dex" Poindexter</strong>, who has incredibly accurate shooting skills and
                    executes some of the attackers even after they surrender.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The FBI house Fisk in the penthouse suite of a hotel they use as a safehouse. News of his release
                    from prison becomes public. Matt vows to stop Fisk and return him to prison. Foggy, unhappy with
                    Matt's demands, tells Karen that Matt is alive. When Fisk learns that Matt survived his attack, he
                    tells the FBI that he has a criminal fixer named Matt Murdock. Dex has psychopathic tendencies. Fisk
                    sees the potential for Dex to become the new villain. Matt offers to testify against Fisk and agrees
                    to turn himself in to the FBI in order to clear his name. Dex instead goes to the Bulletin dressed
                    as Daredevil, fights off Matt and kills a witness.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Daredevil is attacked by the public and media. Nadeem realizes that Dex is the attacker. Matt later
                    overhears Sister Maggie praying about the fact that she is his mother. Fist is blackmailing the FBI.
                    Karen attends a service at Clinton Church when Dex, dressed as Daredevil, arrives and kills <strong
                        class="secundary dead">Lantom</strong>, intending to then kill Karen. Choosing between saving
                    Karen and lying in wait for Fisk, Matt races to the church where he confronts Dex but escapes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Justice Department drops all charges against Fisk, who announces his freedom to the public with
                    a speech that proclaims Daredevil as the public's enemy. Dex kills <strong
                        class="secundary dead">Nadeem</strong> but before, <strong>he sent a video message that serves
                        as his dying declaration, detailing all of Fisk's crimes.</strong> Dex attacks Fisk and Vanessa
                    knowing he has been manipulated. Matt soon joins the fight. Fisk defeats Dex, leaving him paralyzed,
                    while Matt overpowers and beats Fisk but chooses to spare his life. Fisk agrees to return to prison
                    and leave Karen and Foggy alone if Matt does not reveal Vanessa's involvement in Nadeem's death.
                    With Fisk arrested, <strong>Foggy suggests to Matt and Karen that they all start working together
                        again.</strong> Dex later goes through experimental surgery to fix his spine and becomes

                    Jonathan Pangborn, a paraplegic who mysteriously regained use of his legs. Pangborn directs Strange
                    to <em>Kamar-Taj</em>, where he is taken in by <strong class="secundary">Mordo</strong>, a sorcerer
                    under <strong class="secundary">The Ancient One</strong>. The Ancient One demonstrates her power to

                        Levitation</strong>, only to be critically injured during a skirmish. He teleports himself back
                    to the hospital where Palmer saves him. Upon returning to the Sanctum, Strange reveals to Mordo that
                    the Ancient One has been drawing power from the Dark Dimension to sustain her long life, and Mordo
                    becomes disillusioned with the Ancient One. After a fight in the Mirror Dimension of New York,
                    Kaecilius mortally wounds <strong class="secundary dead">the Ancient One</strong> and escapes to
                    Hong Kong. Before dying, she tells Strange that he too will have to bend the rules to complement
                    Mordo's steadfast nature in order to defeat Kaecilius. Strange and Mordo arrive in Hong Kong to find
                    <strong class="secundary presumably-dead">Wong</strong> dead, the Sanctum destroyed, and the Dark
                    Dimension engulfing Earth. Strange uses <strong class="eye-of-agamotto">the Eye</strong> to reverse
                    time and save <strong class="secundary">Wong</strong>, then enters the Dark Dimension and creates a
                    time loop around himself and Dormammu. After repeatedly killing Strange to no avail,
                    <strong>Dormammu finally gives in to Strange's demand that he permanently leave Earth alone and take
                        Kaecilius and his zealots with him</strong> in return for Strange breaking the loop.

                    Disillusioned by Strange and the Ancient One defying nature's laws, Mordo renounces his sorcerer
                    career and departs. Strange returns <strong class="eye-of-agamotto">the Eye</strong> to Kamar-Taj
                    and takes up residence in the New York Sanctum to continue his studies with Wong who says that
                    the Eye is an infinity stone.

                    explains that the realm will soon be destroyed during the prophesied <strong>Ragnarök</strong>, once
                    Surtur unites his crown with the <strong>Eternal Flame</strong> that burns in Odin's vault. Thor
                    frees himself, defeats Surtur and takes his crown, believing he has prevented Ragnarök.

                    City, they locate Odin in Norway. Odin explains that he is dying, Ragnarök is imminent and his
                    passing will free his firstborn child, <strong class="enemy">Hela</strong>, goddes of Death, from a
                    prison she was sealed in long ago. Hela was the leader of Asgard's armies, conquering the Nine
                    Realms with Odin, but Odin imprisoned her and wrote her out of history after fearing that she had
                    become too ambitious and powerful. <strong class="odin dead">Odin</strong> dies as Thor and Loki
                    look on, and Hela appears, destroying Thor's hammer <strong

                    through the Bifröst Bridge, forcing them out into space. Arriving in Asgard, she defeats its army

                    Thor crash-lands on <em>Sakaar</em>, a garbage planet surrounded by wormholes. A slave trader
                    designated <strong class="valkyrie">Scrapper 142</strong> subdues him and sells him as a gladiator
                    to Sakaar's ruler, <strong class="enemy">the Grandmaster</strong>, with whom Loki has already
                    ingratiated himself. Thor recognizes 142 as a <strong>Valkyrie, one of a legendary force of female
                        warriors who were killed fighting Hela eons ago</strong>. Thor is forced to compete in the
                    Grandmaster's Contest of Champions, facing his old friend <strong class="hulk">Hulk</strong>. He
                    follows Thor to a Quinjet, where a recording of Natasha Romanoff causes him to transform back into

                    Thor, she takes Loki captive. Unwilling to be left behind, Loki provides the group with the means to
                    steal one of the Grandmaster's ships. Loki again attempts to betray his brother, but Thor
                    anticipates this and leaves him behind, where <strong class="secundary">Korg, Miek</strong>, and the
                    gladiators soon find him. Thor, Banner, and 142 escape through a wormhole to Asgard, where Hela's

                <p>
                    <strong class="ant-man">Scott Lang</strong> was placed under house arrest due to his involvement
                    with the Avengers, in violation of the Sokovia Accords. <strong class="secundary">Hank Pym</strong>
                    and his daughter <strong class="wasp">Hope van Dyne</strong> briefly manage to open a tunnel to the
                    <em>Quantum Realm</em>. They believe Pym's wife <strong class="secundary">Janet van Dyne</strong>
                    might be trapped there. When he had previously visited the quantum realm, Lang had unknowingly
                    become quantumly entangled with Janet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The trio work to build a stable quantum tunnel so they can take a vehicle to the quantum realm and
                    retrieve her. Hope is attacked by a quantumly unstable <strong class="enemy">masked woman</strong>.
                    Lang tries to help fight off this "ghost", but the woman escapes with Pym's lab, which has been
                    shrunk down to the size of a suitcase.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The ghost captures the trio and reveals herself to be <strong class="enemy">Ava Starr</strong>. Her
                    father, <strong class="secundary dead">Elihas</strong>, was another of Pym's former partners who
                    died along with his wife during an experiment that caused her unstable state. <strong
                        class="secundary">Bill Foster</strong> Pym’s ex-friend and co-worker enters and reveals that Ava
                    is dying and in constant pain as a result of her condition. They plan to cure her using Janet's
                    quantum energy. Believing that this will kill Janet, Pym refuses to help them and escapes with Hope,
                    Lang, and the lab. Pym enters the quantum realm to retrieve Janet, whom he finds alive. Ava regains
                    control of the lab, allowing her to begin taking Janet's energy by force but Pym and Janet return
                    safely from the quantum realm, and Janet voluntarily gives some of her energy to Ava to temporarily
                    stabilize her.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lang returns home once again, in time for a now-suspicious <strong class="secundary">Woo</strong> to
                    release him at the end of his house arrest. Ava and Foster go into hiding. Pym, Lang, Hope, and
                    Janet plan to harvest quantum energy to help Ava remain stable. <strong class="mcu"> While Lang is

                    from the Tesseract, overpowers the <strong class="hulk">Hulk</strong>, and kills <strong

                    and his lieutenants leave, destroying the ship.

                    Hulk crash-lands in the Sanctum Sanctorum in New York City, reverting to the form of Bruce Banner.
                    He warns <strong class="doctor-strange">Stephen Strange</strong> and <strong
                        class="secundary">Wong</strong> about Thanos' plan to destroy half of all life in the universe,
                    and they recruit <strong class="iron-man">Tony Stark</strong>. Maw and Obsidian arrive to retrieve
                    the <strong class="eye-of-agamotto">Time Stone</strong> from Strange, drawing <strong
                        class="spider-man">Peter Parker</strong>'s attention. Maw is unable to take the Time Stone due
                    to an enchantment and captures Strange. Stark and Parker sneak aboard Maw's spaceship while Wong
                    stays behind to guard the Sanctum.

                    Thor surmises that Thanos is going after the <strong class="aether">Reality Stone</strong>, which
                    <strong class="secundary presumably-dead">Taneleer Tivan</strong> possesses on Knowhere. He travels
                    with Rocket and Groot to Nidavellir to enlist the aid of the dwarf king <strong
                        class="secundary">Eitri</strong> in <strong>creating the battle-axe Stormbreaker</strong>. Peter
                    Quill, Gamora, Drax, and <strong class="secundary">Mantis</strong> travel to Knowhere, and they find
                    Thanos possessing the Reality Stone. Thanos kidnaps Gamora, who discloses the <strong

                    from torture. On Vormir, the Stone's keeper, <strong class="enemy">Red Skull</strong>, tells Thanos
                    that he can only acquire it by sacrificing someone he loves. Thanos kills <strong
                        class="gamora dead">Gamora</strong>, earning the Stone.

                        Rhodes</strong> and Banner at the Avengers Compound. Vision asks Maximoff to destroy him and the
                    Mind Stone to keep Thanos from retrieving it, but Maximoff refuses. Rogers suggests they travel to
                    <em>Wakanda</em>, which he believes has the resources to remove the Stone without killing Vision.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nebula escapes captivity and asks the remaining Guardians to meet her on Thanos' destroyed
                    homeworld, Titan. Stark and Parker kill <strong class="enemy dead">Maw</strong> and rescue Strange.
                    They meet Quill, Drax and Mantis after the three Guardians board Maw's ship, and they all land on
                    Titan. Strange uses the Time Stone to view millions of possible futures, <strong>seeing only one in
                        which the Avengers win.</strong> The group formulates a plan to subdue Thanos and remove the
                    <strong class="mcu">Infinity Gauntlet</strong>, which he uses to safely house the Stones. Thanos
                    appears and justifies his plans as necessary to guarantee the survival of a universe threatened by
                    overpopulation. Nebula arrives soon after and helps the others subdue Thanos, but then deduces that
                    Thanos has killed Gamora. Enraged, Quill attacks Thanos, inadvertently allowing him to break the
                    group's hold and overpower them. Thanos grievously wounds Stark, but Strange offers the Time Stone
                    in exchange for sparing Stark's life.

                    In Wakanda, Rogers reunites with <strong class="winter-soldier">Bucky Barnes</strong> before Thanos'
                    army invades. The Avengers, along with <strong class="black-panther">T'Challa</strong> and the
                    Wakandan forces, mount a defense while <strong class="shuri">Shuri</strong> works to extract the
                    Mind Stone from Vision. Unable to summon the Hulk after losing his fight with Thanos, Banner fights
                    in Stark's Hulkbuster armor. Thor, Rocket, and Groot arrive to reinforce the Avengers and together
                    they kill <strong class="enemy dead">Midnight, Obsidian, and Glaive</strong>. Although Thanos' army
                    is routed, Shuri is unable to complete the extraction before Thanos himself arrives on the field.
                    Maximoff destroys the <strong class="mind-stone dead">Mind Stone</strong> and Vision, but Thanos
                    uses the <strong class="eye-of-agamotto">Time Stone</strong> to reverse her actions and rips the
                    repaired <strong class="mind-stone">Mind Stone</strong> from <strong
                        class="vision presumably-dead">Vision</strong> 's forehead, killing him. Thor severely wounds
                    Thanos with Stormbreaker, but Thanos activates the completed <strong class="mcu"> Gauntlet by
                        snapping his fingers before teleporting away.</strong>
