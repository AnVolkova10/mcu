                        the engine herself</strong>, Danvers <strong class="mcu">absorbed the energy from the ensuing

                    Danvers, Talos, Fury, and Rambeau locate Lawson's cloaked laboratory orbiting Earth, where Lawson
                    hid several Skrulls,
                    including Talos' family, and the <strong class="tesseract">Tesseract</strong>, the <strong>power
                        source of
                        Lawson's engine</strong>. There, Danvers is captured by Starforce and interfaces with the
                    Supreme Intelligence. Danvers removes the <strong>Kree implant</strong> that suppressed her powers
                    during their conversation, allowing her to reach her <strong>full potential</strong>. In the
                    subsequent battle, Fury retrieves Goose, who is revealed to be an <strong class="goose">alien
                        Flerken</strong>, he <strong>swallows the Tesseract</strong> and scratches Fury's eye. Danvers
                    destroys a Kree bomber, forcing Kree officer <strong class="enemy">Ronan the Accuser</strong> and
                    his squadron to retreat before overpowering Yon-Rogg on Earth and sending him back to Hala with a
                    warning to the Supreme Intelligence. Danvers departs to help the Skrulls find a new homeworld,
                    leaving Fury a <strong class="mcu">modified pager to contact her in an emergency</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Meanwhile, Fury <strong class="mcu">drafts an initiative</strong> to locate heroes like Danvers,
                    naming
                    it after her Air Force call sign, <strong class="mcu">"Avenger".</strong> In another time and alone,

                    <strong class="iron-man">Tony Stark</strong>, who has inherited the defense contractor <em>Stark
                        Industries</em> from his father Howard Stark, is in war-torn Afghanistan with his friend and
                    military liaison, Lieutenant Colonel <strong class="war-machine">James Rhodes</strong>, to
                    demonstrate the new "Jericho" missile. After the demonstration, the convoy is ambushed and Stark is
                    critically wounded by a missile used by the attackers: one of his company's own. He is captured by a
                    terrorist group called the <em>Ten Rings</em>. <strong class="secundary">Yinsen</strong>, a fellow
                    captive doctor, implants an <strong>electromagnet</strong> into Stark's chest to keep the shrapnel
                    shards that wounded him from reaching his heart and killing him. Stark and Yinsen secretly build a
                    small, powerful electric generator called an <strong>arc reactor</strong> to power Stark's
                    electromagnet and a <strong>prototype suit of powered armor</strong> to aid in their escape. <strong

                    and his father's legacy. In his home workshop, Stark builds in secret a <strong>sleeker, more
                        powerful version of his improvised armor suit</strong> as well as a <strong>more powerful arc
                        reactor</strong>. Personal assistant <strong class="pepper">Pepper Potts</strong> places the

                    <strong>searching

                    <strong class="enemy">General Ross</strong> sends a special forces team, led by <strong

                    defeats
                    Blonsky's team. Blonsky agrees to be <strong>injected</strong> with a small amount of a similar
                    serum of Banner, which gives him <strong>enhanced speed, strength, agility, and healing</strong>
                    and
                    begins to <strong>deform his skeleton and impairs his judgment</strong>.

                    Banner returns to Culver University and reunites with <strong class="betty">Betty</strong>. He is
                    attacked a
                    second time by Ross and Blonsky's forces. Banner contacts Mr. Blue, who urges them to meet him in
                    New
                    York City. He is a cellular biologist named <strong class="enemy">Dr. Samuel Sterns</strong>, who
                    tells Banner he has developed a possible antidote.. After a <strong>successful test</strong>, he
                    warns
                    Banner that the antidote may only reverse each transformation. Sterns reveals he has
                    <strong>synthesized Banner's blood samples</strong>, into a large supply, to apply its
                    <strong>"limitless potential"</strong>. Banner wishes to destroy the blood supply. A recovered
                    Blonsky joins Ross' forces for a third attempt to take Banner into custody. They succeed, and
                    Banner and Betty are taken away in a helicopter. Blonsky stays behind and orders <strong

                    In Stuttgart, Barton steals <strong>iridium needed to stabilize the Tesseract's power</strong> while
                    Loki causes a distraction, leading to a brief confrontation with Rogers, Stark, and Romanoff that
                    ends with <strong>Loki's surrender</strong>. While Loki gets escorted to S.H.I.E.L.D., <strong

                    Upon arrival, Loki gets imprisoned while Banner and Stark attempt to locate the Tesseract. The

                        motivate</strong> the Avengers into working as a team.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Loki uses the <strong lass="mcu">Tesseract, and a wormhole generator</strong> Selvig built, to open
                    a wormhole above Stark Tower to the <strong>Chitauri fleet</strong> in space, launching his
                    invasion.
                    Rogers, Stark, Romanoff, Barton, and Thor rally in defense of New York City. Banner arrives and
                    transforms into the Hulk, and together the Avengers battle the Chitauri while evacuating civilians.
                    The Hulk <strong>beats Loki into submission</strong>. Romanoff makes her way to the generator, where
                    <strong class="secundary">Selvig</strong>, freed from Loki's mind control, reveals that Loki's
                    scepter can shut down the generator. Meanwhile, Fury's superiors from the <em>World Security
                        Council</em> attempt to end the invasion by <strong>launching a nuclear missile.</strong> Stark
                    <strong>intercepts the missile and takes it through the wormhole</strong> toward the Chitauri fleet.
                    The <strong>missile detonates, destroying the Chitauri mothership and disabling their forces
                    </strong> on Earth. Stark's suit loses power, and he falls back through the wormhole just as

                    injured in one such attack and is put into a coma, prompting Stark to boldly issue a televised
                    threat to the Mandarin, revealing his home address in the process. The Mandarin sends gunship

                    following a flight plan from Stark's investigation into the Mandarin. Stark's new armor is not fully

                    dead.
                    Stark investigates the remains of a local explosion bearing the hallmarks of a Mandarin attack. He
                    discovers the "bombings" were triggered by soldiers subjected to <strong>Extremis whose bodies
                        explosively rejected the treatment</strong>. These explosions were falsely attributed to a

                    In Asgard, <strong class="loki">Loki</strong> stands imprisoned for his war crimes on Earth.
                    Meanwhile, <strong class="thor">Thor</strong>, alongside warriors <strong class="secundary">Fandral,
                        Volstagg,</strong> and <strong class="sif">Sif</strong>, wins the final battle in a war to
                    pacify the Nine Realms following the <strong>reconstruction of the Bifröst</strong>. They learn that
                    <strong>the Convergence</strong>, a rare alignment of the Nine Realms, is imminent; as the event
                    approaches, portals linking the worlds appear at random.

                <p>
                    In London, <strong class="jane">Jane Foster</strong> and her intern <strong class="darcy">Darcy
                        Lewis</strong> travel to an abandoned factory where such portals have appeared, Foster is
                    teleported to another world, she absorbs <strong class="aether">the Aether</strong>.
                    <strong class="heimdall">Heimdall</strong> alerts Thor that Foster has moved beyond his near
                    all-seeing vision, leading Thor to find Foster, she inadvertently releases an <strong>unearthly
                        force</strong>, and Thor returns with her to Asgard. <strong class="odin">Odin</strong>,
                    recognizing the Aether, warns that the Aether will not only kill Foster but that its return heralds
                    a catastrophic prophecy.
                    <strong class="enemy">Malekith</strong>, awakened by the Aether's release, turns <strong
                        class="enemy">Algrim</strong> into a <strong class="enemy">Kursed</strong> and attacks Asgard.
                    During the battle, Malekith and Algrim search for Foster and Thor's mother <strong

                    Defying Odin, Thor enlists the help of Loki, who knows of a <strong>secret portal</strong>
                    to Svartalfheim, where they will use Foster to lure and confront Malekith.
                    Loki tricks Malekith into drawing the Aether out of Foster, but Thor's attempt to destroy the
                    exposed substance fails. Malekith merges with the Aether and leaves in his ship as <strong

                        class="secundary dead">Algrim</strong>. Thor and Foster discover another portal and reunite in
                    London with <strong class="secundary">Dr. Erik Selvig</strong>—who was briefly institutionalized due
                    to the mental trauma he suffered during Loki's attack on Earth. Malekith plans to restore the Dark
                    Elves to dominance by unleashing the Aether at the center of the Convergence in Greenwich. Thor
                    battles <strong class="dead enemy">Malekith</strong> and wins.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thor returns to Asgard, where he declines <strong class="presumably-dead odin">Odin</strong>'s offer
                    to take the throne and tells Odin of Loki's sacrifice. As he leaves, Odin's form transforms into
                    <strong class="loki">Loki</strong>, who is alive and impersonating Odin.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Volstagg and Sif visit <strong class="secundary">the Collector</strong> and entrust <strong

                    asks senior S.H.I.E.L.D. official and Secretary of Internal Security <strong

                    <strong>S.H.I.E.L.D. is compromised</strong>, but is killed by the Winter Soldier, before handing
                    Rogers a <strong>flash drive containing the ship's data</strong>. Fury is pronounced dead during
                    surgery, and Hill recovers the body. The next day, Pierce summons Rogers to the Triskelion. When
                    Rogers withholds Fury's information, Pierce brands him a fugitive.

                    Using the data, they discover a secret S.H.I.E.L.D. bunker in New Jersey, where they activate a

                        Zola</strong>. He informs them that since S.H.I.E.L.D. was founded after World War II,
                    <em>Hydra</em> has infiltrated and <strong>operated within its ranks,</strong> sowing global chaos
                    with the objective of making humanity surrender its freedom in exchange for security. The pair

                    Rogers and Romanoff enlist the help of former USAF pararescueman <strong class="falcon">Sam

                    faked his death, plans to sabotage the Helicarriers by replacing their controller chips.
                    Fury arrives and forces Pierce to unlock S.H.I.E.L.D.'s database so that Romanoff can <strong>leak
                        classified information, exposing Hydra to the public</strong>. Following a struggle, Fury kills

                    and Wilson storm two Helicarriers and replace the controller chips, but the Winter Soldier fights
                    Rogers on the third. Rogers fends him off and replaces the final chip, allowing Hill to <strong>take
                        control and have the vessels destroy each other</strong>. Rogers refuses to fight the Winter
                    Soldier, he rescues the unconscious Rogers before disappearing into the woods.

                    With S.H.I.E.L.D. in disarray, Romanoff appears before a Senate subcommittee, while Fury, under the

                        class="mcu">mysterious orb</strong>, but is attacked by <strong class="enemy">Korath</strong>,
                    of the fanatical Kree renegade, <strong class="enemy">Ronan the Accuser</strong>. Although Quill
                    escapes with the orb, <strong class="enemy">Yondu</strong> (his boss) discovers his theft and issues
                    a bounty for his capture, while Ronan sends the assassin <strong class="gamora">Gamora</strong>
                    after the orb.
                </p>
                <p>When Quill attempts to sell the orb on Xandar, capital of the Nova Empire, Gamora ambushes him and
                    steals it. A fight ensues, drawing in a pair of bounty hunters: the genetically and cybernetically
                    modified raccoon <strong class="rocket">Rocket</strong>, and the tree-like humanoid <strong
                        class="groot">Groot</strong>. Nova Corps officers capture the four, detaining them in the Kyln
                    prison. An inmate there, <strong class="drax">Drax the Destroyer</strong>, attempts to kill Gamora
                    due to her association with the powerful intergalactic warlord, <strong
                        class="boss">Thanos</strong>, and Ronan, who killed his family. Quill convinces Drax that Gamora
                    can bring Ronan to him, though Gamora reveals that she has betrayed Ronan, unwilling to let him use
                    the orb's power. Learning that Gamora intends to sell the orb to <strong class="secundary">the
                        Collector Taneleer Tivan</strong>, Quill, Rocket, Groot, and Drax work with her to escape the
                    Kyln in Quill's ship, <strong>the Milano.</strong></p>
                <p>
                    Tivan opens the orb, revealing <strong class="power-stone">the Power Stone</strong>, an item of
                    <strong>immeasurable power that destroys all but the most powerful beings who wield it. </strong>
                    Tivan's slave Carina grabs the Stone, triggering an explosion that engulfs Tivan's archive. Ronan
                    arrives and easily defeats Drax, while the others flee by ship, pursued by Ronan's followers and
                    Gamora's adoptive sister <strong class="enemy">Nebula</strong>. Nebula destroys Gamora's ship,
                    leaving her floating in space, and Ronan's fighters capture the orb.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Yondu arrives and retrieves the pair. Quill negotiates a truce, promising the orb to Yondu. On
                    Ronan's flagship, the Dark Aster, Ronan <strong class="mcu">embeds the Stone in his warhammer,
                        taking its power for himself.</strong> He contacts Thanos, threatening to kill him after first
                    destroying Xandar; hateful of her adoptive father, Nebula allies with Ronan. The Ravagers and
                    Quill's group join with the Nova Corps to confront the Dark Aster at Xandar, with Quill's group
                    breaching the Dark Aster with the Milano. Ronan uses his empowered warhammer to destroy the Nova
                    Corps fleet. Drax kills <strong class="secundary dead">Korath</strong> and Gamora defeats Nebula,
                    who escapes, Rocket crashes a Ravager ship through the Dark Aster. Damaged, crash-lands on Xandar,
                    with <strong class="groot presumably">Groot</strong> sacrificing himself to shield the group. Ronan
                    emerges from the wreck and Drax and Rocket to destroy <strong class="mcu dead">Ronan's
                        warhammer</strong>. Quill grabs the freed <strong class="power-stone">Power Stone</strong>, and
                    with Gamora, Drax, and Rocket sharing its burden, uses it to vaporize <strong
                        class="enemy dead">Ronan</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the aftermath, Quill tricks Yondu and gives the real <strong class="power-stone">Stone</strong>
                    to the <em>Nova Corps</em>. As the Ravagers leave Xandar, Yondu remarks that it turned out well that
                    <strong class="mcu">they did not deliver Quill to his father per their contract</strong>. Quill's
                    group, now known as <strong>the Guardians of the Galaxy</strong>, has their criminal records
                    expunged, and Quill learns that <strong class="mcu">he is only half-human</strong>, his father being
                    part of an ancient, unknown species. Quill finally opens the last present he received from his
                    mother, a cassette tape filled with her favorite songs. <strong class="groot">Groot</strong> grows
                    into a baby version of him.

                        class="enemy">Nebula</strong>. After Rocket steals the batteries for himself, the Sovereign
                    attacks the Guardians' ship with a
                    fleet of drones. A <strong>mysterious figure destroys the drones</strong>, whom reveals to be
                    Quill's father, <strong class="enemy">Ego</strong>, and invites them to his home planet. Rocket and
                    Groot remain behind to repair the ship and guard
                    Nebula.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ayesha hires <strong class="enemy">Yondu Udonta</strong>, who have been exiled from
                    <em>the Ravager</em> community for child trafficking, to recapture the Guardians.
                    They capture Rocket, but when Yondu hesitates to turn over Quill, whom he raised,
                    his assistant <strong class="secundary">Kraglin Obfonteri</strong> questions his objectivity,
                    and his lieutenant <strong class="enemy">Taserface</strong> leads a mutiny with help from Nebula.
                    Nebula leaves to find and kill Gamora, whom she blames for the torture inflicted on her
                    by their father, Thanos. While imprisoned, Rocket and <strong class="secundary">Yondu</strong>
                    bond. Groot and Kraglin, free Rocket and Yondu, and they destroy the ship and its crew
                    as they escape, but <strong class="enemy dead">Taserface</strong> warns the Sovereign before dying.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ego, a <strong>god-like Celestial that manipulated the matter around</strong> its
                    consciousness to form this "home" planet, explains that he projected a humanoid guise to travel
                    the universe and discover a purpose. Ego hired Yondu to collect the young Quill after
                    <strong class="secundary">Meredith's</strong> death, but the boy was never delivered,
                    and Ego has been searching for him ever since. He teaches Quill <strong>to manipulate the
                        Celestial power.</strong> Nebula arrives at Ego's planet and tries to kill Gamora,
                    but the pair reach an uneasy alliance when they discover a <strong>cavern filled with
                        skeletal remains.</strong> Ego reveals to Quill that in his travels, he planted seedlings
                    on thousands of worlds that can terraform into new extensions of himself,
                    but only the power of two Celestials can activate them.
                    To that end, he impregnated countless women and hired Yondu to collect the children,
                    but killed them all when they failed to access the Celestial power.
                    Under Ego's influence, Quill helps him activate the seedlings, which <strong>begin to consume
                        every world</strong>, but Quill fights back when Ego reveals that <strong>he gave Meredith the
                        tumor that killed her</strong>. <strong class="mantis">Mantis</strong>, Ego's naïve empath
                    servant,
                    grows close to Drax and warns him of Ego's plan. The reunited Guardians find Ego's brain at the
                    planet's core as they come under attack from the Sovereign's drones. Rocket makes a bomb using
                    the stolen batteries, which Groot plants on the brain. Quill fights Ego with his newfound Celestial
                    powers to distract him. <strong>The bomb explodes</strong>, killing <strong class="enemy dead">
                        Ego</strong> and disintegrating the planet. Quill <strong>loses his Celestial powers</strong>
                    soon after Ego's death. <strong class="secundary dead">Yondu</strong> sacrifices himself to
                    save Quill and dies in the vacuum of space.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Quill then realizes that Yondu kept him to spare him from the fate of Ego's other progeny. Having
                    reconciled with Gamora, <strong class="nebula">Nebula</strong> still chooses to leave and resume
                    her quest to kill Thanos by
                    herself. The Guardians hold a funeral for Yondu, which Kraglin and dozens of Ravager ships attend,
                    acknowledging Yondu's sacrifice and accepting him as a Ravager again. During the funeral, Gamora
                    admits that she feels things for Peter too.

                    Martial Arts. He went to college and befriended <strong class="secundary">Foggy Nelson</strong>. The

                    death. Even well into his adult years, his father’s dark lessons in cruelty, power, respect, and
                    control helped mold him into the man he is today, <strong class="enemy">the Kingpin</strong>.</p>

                    Crime is in an all-time high due to the rise of a crime syndicate: utilizing drugs, weapons, and
                    gangs to de-value the local property; to remake them into new crime-controlled buildings.
                    Their very first client, <strong class="secundary">Karen Page</strong>, grateful for the duo’s save,
                    decides to work with them. Murdock continued his vigilantism and Wilson Fisk, falls in love to art
                    curator, <strong class="enemy">Vanessa Marianna</strong>. Meanwhile, Nelson and Page had been
                    secretly working
                    with <strong class="secundary dead">Ben Urich</strong> to build a credible case against Fisk.

                    Fisk for criminal activity and was arrested. Finally donning the Daredevil costume, Murdock
                    personally takes on Fisk as Daredevil, and wins after a fairly difficult fight. <strong>
                        Fisk</strong> is now arrested
                    and in jail; Marianna escaped and left the city. Murdock continued on his guardianship and

                    In the Eastern European country of Sokovia, the Avengers: <strong class="iron-man">Tony

                    —raid a <em>Hydra facility</em> commanded by <strong class="enemy">Baron Wolfgang von
                        Strucker</strong>, who has experimented on humans using the scepter previously wielded by Loki.
                    They meet two of Strucker's test subjects—twins <strong class="pietro">Pietro</strong> (who has
                    superhuman speed) and <strong class="scarlet-witch">Wanda Maximoff</strong> (who has telepathic and
                    telekinetic abilities)—and apprehend Strucker, while Stark retrieves <strong class="mcu">Loki's
                        scepter</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Stark and Banner discover an <strong>artificial intelligence within the scepter's gem</strong>, and
                    secretly decide to use it to complete Stark's <strong>"Ultron" global defense program</strong>. The
                    unexpectedly sentient <strong class="enemy">Ultron</strong>, believing he must <strong>eradicate
                        humanity to save Earth</strong>, eliminates Stark's A.I. <strong
                        class="jarvis presumably-dead">J.A.R.V.I.S.</strong> and attacks the Avengers at their
                    headquarters. Escaping with the scepter, Ultron uses the resources in Strucker's Sokovia base to
                    upgrade his rudimentary body and build an army of robot drones. Having killed <strong
                        class="enemy dead">Strucker</strong>, he recruits the Maximoffs, who hold Stark responsible for
                    their parents' deaths by his company's weapons, and goes to get <strong>vibranium</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A worldwide backlash over the resulting destruction, and the fears <strong>Wanda's hallucinations
                        incited</strong>, send the team into hiding at Barton's farmhouse. Thor departs to consult with
                    <strong class="secundary">Dr. Erik Selvig</strong> on the apocalyptic future he saw in his
                    hallucination, while <strong class="fury">Nick Fury</strong> arrives and encourages the team to form
                    a plan to stop Ultron. Ultron uses Loki's scepter to enslave the team's friend <strong
                        class="secundary">Helen Cho</strong>. They use her <strong>synthetic-tissue technology,
                        vibranium, and the scepter's gem to craft a new body</strong>. As Ultron uploads himself into
                    the body, Wanda is able to read his mind; discovering his plan for human extinction, <strong>the
                        Maximoffs turn against Ultron</strong>. Rogers, Romanoff, and Barton fight Ultron and retrieve
                    the synthetic body, but Ultron captures Romanoff.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Stark and Banner secretly upload <strong class="jarvis">J.A.R.V.I.S.</strong> —who is still working
                    after hiding from Ultron inside the Internet—into the synthetic body. Thor returns to help activate
                    the body, based on <strong class="mcu">his vision</strong> that the gem on its brow is the <strong
                        class="mind-stone">Mind Stone</strong>, one of <strong class="mcu">the six Infinity
                        Stones</strong>, <strong>the most powerful objects in existence</strong>. This "<strong

                        hammer, Mjölnir</strong>. The <strong class="mind-stone">Mind Stone</strong> is in Vision's
                    head.
                    Him and the Maximoffs go with the Avengers to Sokovia, where Ultron
                    has used the remaining vibranium to build a machine to lift a large part of the capital city
                    skyward, intending to crash it into the ground to cause global extinction. Banner rescues Romanoff,
                    who awakens the Hulk for the battle. The Avengers fight Ultron's army while Fury arrives in a
                    Helicarrier with <strong class="maria-hill">Maria Hill</strong>, <strong class="war-machine">James
                        Rhodes</strong>, and <em>S.H.I.E.L.D.</em> agents to evacuate civilians. <strong
                        class="pietro dead">Pietro</strong> dies when he shields Barton from gunfire, and a vengeful
                    Wanda abandons her post to destroy <strong class=" enemy pressumably dead">Ultron</strong>'s primary
                    body, which allows one of his drones to activate the machine. The city plummets, but Stark and Thor
                    overload the machine and shatter the landmass. In the aftermath, the Hulk, unwilling to endanger
                    Romanoff by being with her, departs in a Quinjet, while Vision confronts and seemingly destroys
                    <strong class="enemy dead">Ultron</strong>'s last remaining body.

                <p>
                    Thor returns to Asgard to learn more about the forces he suspects have manipulated major events. As
                    Stark leaves and Barton retires, Rogers and Romanoff prepare to <strong>train new Avengers:</strong>

                    with the intention of putting him through Burstein's procedure as a test subject. Stryker appears
                    wearing a <strong>Hammer's powered suit</strong> which allows him to match Cage's strength and
                    invulnerability. Cage tasks Knight to go after Dillard and Alvarez while he engages Stryker. Federal

                    For over 15 years, <strong class="iron-fist">Danny Rand</strong> trained to become a warrior monk
                    and, after passing a deadly test, was

                    L'un and the destroyer of <em>The Hand</em>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Danny leaves K'un L'un in search for revenge and returns to New York to claim his rightful place at
                    his family's company, <em>Rand Enterprises</em>. Since he was presumed dead for all those years, he
                    is met with nothing but hostility. His former childhood friends, <strong class="enemy">Joy and Ward
                        Meachum</strong> — fear that he wants to take over their company; Ward tries to have Danny
                    killed, while Joy orchestrates his committal to a mental hospital. He seeks help from <strong

                        class="claire">Claire Temple</strong> (Colleen student). Danny uses <strong>the power of the

                        all-powerful hand and unmatched fighting skills)</strong> to escape the hospital and flee to
                    Colleen's dojo.
                    With the help of <strong class="secundary">Jeri Hogarth</strong> he is able to prove his identity
                    and reclaim his rightful position within the company.

                <p>
                    Meanwhile, the Meachum patriarch, <strong class="enemy">Harold</strong> , is busy pulling strings
                    behind the scenes at the company.
                    Danny and Colleen had developed a relationship and fallen in love, so he is distraught when he
                    learns of her deceit: she is from <em>The Hand</em> (but was kinda brainwashed) but decides to
                    follow
                    Danny,

                    friend from K'un L'un, he's
                    extremely jealous that Danny was granted the power; he's also upset that Danny abandoned K'un L'un
                    and left it unprotected.
                    In a final battle, <strong class="enemy dead">Harold</strong> is killed and Ward finds the evidence
                    they need to clear Danny and Colleen
                    of the DEA's allegations. Harold is cremated, Ward takes over Rand Enterprises, and Danny and
                    Colleen
                    venture to K'un L'un to learn more about the Iron Fist. However, when they arrive, they find that
                    the city has vanished without a trace. As for Joy and Davos, they have teamed up and are in France
                    concocting a plan to take down Danny — a plan that an escaped <strong class="enemy">Madame

                    intentions to kill him, Rogers decides to try to bring in Barnes himself. Rogers and Wilson track
                    Barnes to Bucharest and attempt to protect him from T'Challa and the authorities, but all four,
                    including T'Challa, are apprehended by the Bucharest police and <strong class="war-machine">James

                <p>
                    Rogers stops Barnes and sneaks him away. When Barnes regains his senses, he explains that Zemo is
                    the real Vienna bomber and wanted the location of the Siberian Hydra base, where other brainwashed
                    "Winter Soldiers" are kept in cryogenic stasis. Rogers and Wilson go rogue, and recruit Maximoff,
                    <strong class="hawkeye">Clint Barton</strong>, and <strong class="ant-man">Scott Lang</strong> to
                    their cause. With Ross's permission, Stark assembles a team composed of Romanoff, T'Challa, Rhodes,

                    capture the renegades. Stark's team intercepts Rogers' group at Leipzig/Halle Airport, where they
                    fight until Romanoff allows Rogers and Barnes to escape. As Rogers and Barnes are escaping, Rhodes
                    is inadvertently shot down by Vision (who was ~falling in love~ with Wanda), and becomes partially
                    paralyzed. The rest of Rogers' team is captured and detained at the Raft prison, and Romanoff goes

                    Stark discovers evidence that Barnes was framed by Zemo and convinces Wilson to give him Rogers'

                    Stark goes to the Siberian Hydra facility and strikes a truce
                    with Rogers and Barnes, unaware that they were secretly followed by T'Challa. They find that the
                    other super-soldiers have been killed by Zemo, who then shows them footage that reveals that the
                    automobile Barnes had intercepted in 1991 contained Stark's parents, whom Barnes subsequently
                    killed. Enraged that Rogers kept this from him, Stark turns on them both, leading to an intense
                    fight, in which Stark destroys Barnes' robotic arm, and Rogers disables Stark's armor. Rogers
                    departs with Barnes, <strong>leaving his shield behind</strong>. Satisfied that he has avenged his
                    family's deaths in Sokovia from the Avengers' actions by successfully fracturing them, Zemo attempts
                    suicide, but he is stopped by T'Challa and taken to the authorities.

                    <strong class="black-panther">T'Challa</strong> returns to <em>Wakanda</em> to assume the throne. At
                    the ceremony is <strong class="okoye">Okoye</strong>, the leader of the Dora Milaje regiment,
                    hiss ex-lover <strong class="nakia">Nakia</strong>, his mother <strong
                        class="secundary">Ramonda</strong> and younger sister <strong class="shuri">Shuri</strong>,
                    the <em>Jabari Tribe's</em> leader <strong class="secundary">M'Baku</strong> challenges T'Challa for
                    the crown in ritual combat. T'Challa defeats M'Baku and persuades him to yield rather than die.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When <strong class="enemy">Klaue</strong> and his accomplice <strong class="enemy">Erik
                        Stevens</strong> steal a Wakandan artifact from a London museum, T'Challa, Okoye, and Nakia
                    travel to Busan, South Korea, where Klaue plans to sell the artifact to CIA agent <strong
                        class="secundary">Everett K. Ross</strong>. Klaue tells Ross that Wakanda's international image
                    is a front for a technologically advanced civilization. Erik attacks and extracts Klaue as Ross is
                    gravely injured protecting Nakia. Rather than pursue Klaue, T'Challa takes Ross to Wakanda, where
                    their technology can save him.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While Shuri heals Ross, T'Challa confronts Zuri about N'Jobu. Zuri explains that N'Jobu planned to
                    share Wakanda's technology with people of African descent around the world to help them conquer
                    their oppressors. The boy they left grew up to be Stevens, a black ops U.S. Navy SEAL who adopted
                    the name "Killmonger". Meanwhile, Killmonger kills <strong class="enemy dead">Klaue</strong> and
                    takes his body to Wakanda. He is brought before the tribal elders, revealing his identity to be
                    <strong class="enemy">N'Jadaka</strong> and claim to the throne. Killmonger challenges T'Challa to
                    ritual combat, where he kills Zuri, defeats <strong
                        class="black-panther presumably-dead">T'Challa</strong>, and hurls him over a waterfall to his
                    presumed death. Killmonger <strong>ingests the heart-shaped herb and orders the rest incinerated,
                        but Nakia extracts one first.</strong> Killmonger, supported by W'Kabi and his army, prepares to
                    distribute shipments of Wakandan weapons to operatives around the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nakia, Shuri, Ramonda, and Ross flee to the Jabari Tribe for aid. They find a comatose <strong
                        class="black-panther">T'Challa</strong>, rescued by the Jabari in repayment for sparing M'Baku's
                    life. Healed by Nakia's herb, T'Challa returns to fight Killmonger, who dons his own nanotech suit,
                    similar to T'Challa's. W'Kabi and his army fight Shuri, Nakia, and the Dora Milaje, while Ross
                    remotely pilots a jet and shoots down planes carrying the vibranium weapons. M'Baku and the Jabari
                    arrive to reinforce T'Challa. Confronted by Okoye, W'Kabi and his army stand down. Fighting in
                    Wakanda's vibranium mine, T'Challa disrupts Killmonger's suit and stabs him. <strong
                        class="enemy dead">Killmonger</strong> refuses to be healed, choosing to die a free man rather
                    than be incarcerated.
                </p>
                <p>
                    T'Challa <strong> establishes an outreach center at the building where N'Jobu died</strong>, to be
                    run by Nakia and Shuri. <strong>T'Challa appears before the United Nations to reveal Wakanda's true
                        nature to the world.</strong> Shuri helps <strong class="winter-soldier">Bucky Barnes</strong>
                    with his recovery.

                    Attilan is ruled by <em>the Inhuman Royal Family</em>, at the top of which are King <strong
